# 1. Stack (local / automatic storage)

- Used for **local variables** declared inside a function, e.g.    
	```c++
	void foo() {
	    int a = 10;
	    Point p;
	}
	```
- Memory is **automatically allocated** when the function starts and **automatically freed** when the function returns.
- Fast allocation (just moving the stack pointer)
- Limited lifetime â†’ disappears after function ends
- Example:
    ```c++
    Point p;   // stored directly on the stack`
    ```
# 2. Heap (dynamic storage)

- Used when you explicitly request memory using `new` / `malloc`.
- Memory **stays valid** until you free it (`delete` / `free`).
- Slower allocation (requires system call)
- Needed when:
    - You want data to **survive** after a function returns.
    - The size of data is **unknown** at compile time.
- Example:
	```c++
	Point* ptr = new Point();  // allocated on the heap ptr->x = 3; ptr->y = 7;`
    
    Stack: contains only the pointer (address) 
    Heap:  contains the actual Point {x=3, y=7}
	```
